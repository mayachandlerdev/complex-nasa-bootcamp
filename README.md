# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

### Goal: Use NASA's API to return all of their facility locations (~400). Display the name of the facility, its location, and the weather at the facility currently. 

Welcome to my complex NASA API! 

For this, you'll automatically recieve all of NASA's locations with a click of a button and then you will get the current weather from another API in response! 

||Still a work in progress||
